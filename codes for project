Sequencing dataset: GSE73727 (Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO)
Click SRA RUN Selector in the supplementary file (There are 70 samples [70 cells]), download 70 samples by using "prefetch" one by one.
Download SRA toolkit environment: 
(base) [xinqianc@colossus long_term_project]$ wget http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current (https://ncbi.github.io/sra-tools/install_config.html) 
(base) [xinqianc@colossus long_term_project]$tar -xzf sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz (unpacking tar file)
(base) [xinqianc@colossus long_term_project]$cd sratoolkit.2.9.6-1-centos_linux64/
(base) [xinqianc@colossus sratoolkit.2.9.6-1-centos_linux64]$ cd bin (prefetch and fastq-dump is in bin file)
(base) [xinqianc@colossus bin]$  ./prefetch -v SRR2558111 (prefetch can only use under bin file and need to add ./ before)
(Troubleshooting: disk quota exceed) (Solution : https://ncgas.org/Blog_Posts/SRA%20toolkit.php; http://ncbi.github.io/sra-tools/install_config.html)
I still can not download SRR although I changed the environment to scratch....?????

how to fix this problem: 
(1)(command to change path: ./vdb-config -i)
change path to scratch/long_term_data ( because if I only change the path to scratch, it will pop up that this directory is not empty
. However, bin file is still in long_term_project.
(2)run : vdb-config --restore-defaults
(3)and then we could successfully run the sample fastq-dump file now
I have tried prefetch yet, because prefetch file is bigger, fastq-dump could also provide enough information.


(base) [xinqianc@colossus ~]$ cd scratch
(base) [xinqianc@colossus scratch]$ mkdir long_term_project
(base) [xinqianc@colossus scratch]$ cd long_term_project/
