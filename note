Read QC--> Alignment --> Mapping QC --> Cell QC --> Normalization --> Confounders
--> network, clustering, differential expression....
(orange: scRNA, blue: general)


2.read1,read2 from the same transcript, read 2 has cell barcode sequence.
##(1)Unique Molecular Identifiers:
Unique Molecular Identifiers are short (4-10bp) random barcodes added to transcripts during reverse-transcription. 
They enable sequencing reads to be assigned to individual transcript molecules and thus the removal of amplification noise and biases from scRNASeq data.
[Like INS gene transcripts to two RNAs, these two RNAs are the same, but they have different UMIs.]
(Problems could happen in UMIs (when doing PCR, errors like basepair substitution could happen and make things complex.)
##(2)Cell Barcodes
Know reads belong to which cells

3.demultiplexing
Demultiplexing refers to the step in processing where you'd use the barcode information
in order to know which sequences came from which samples after they had all be sequenced together.

4. Use STAR to align reads
