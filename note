1.WorkfLow
Read QC--> Alignment --> Mapping QC --> Cell QC --> Normalization --> Confounders
--> network, clustering, differential expression....
(orange: scRNA, blue: general)


2.read1,read2 from the same transcript, read 2 has cell barcode sequence.
##(1)Unique Molecular Identifiers:
Unique Molecular Identifiers are short (4-10bp) random barcodes added to transcripts during reverse-transcription. 
They enable sequencing reads to be assigned to individual transcript molecules and thus the removal of amplification noise and biases from scRNASeq data.
[Like INS gene transcripts to two RNAs, these two RNAs are the same, but they have different UMIs.]
(Problems could happen in UMIs (when doing PCR, errors like basepair substitution could happen and make things complex.)
##(2)Cell Barcodes
Know reads belong to which cells

3.demultiplexing
Demultiplexing refers to the step in processing where you'd use the barcode information
in order to know which sequences came from which samples after they had all be sequenced together.

------------------------------------------------
we don't need to worry about UMI,demultiplexing those steps, they are those steps before we get the raw reads (like pair-end reads, read1,read2)
from each cell.
I think they are done by illumina company, so the customer get raw reads from each cell and process the data.

4. Use STAR to align reads
Find Ref transcriptomes: https://useast.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html

(1)first, to put ref:genome into new make directory:indices/STAR (Generating genome index)
STAR manual: https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf
mkdir indices
mkdir indices/STAR
STAR --runThreadN 4 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir indices/STAR --genomeFastaFiles Share/2000_reference.transcripts.fa
(2)perform the mapping step
STAR --runThreadN 4 --genomeDir indices/STAR --readFilesIn Share/ERR522959_1.fastq Share/ERR522959_2.fastq --outFileNamePrefix results/STAR/
output file format: BAM
change formats: 
# sort reads by name
samtools sort -n original.bam -o sorted_by_name.bam
# remove secondary alignments
samtools view -b -F 256 sorted_by_name.bam -o primary_alignment_only.bam
# convert to fastq
bedtools bamtofastq -i primary_alignment_only.bam -fq read1.fq -fq2 read2.fq

PS: when do the alignment, we need to be aware of RNA spkie-in ??(But I think it is tackled before raw reads.)

(3) do mapping QC
RSEQC (check the quality)

(4)Reads quantification: to quantify the expression level of each gene for each cell
HT-seq
